# **Project 1: Autonomous Attendance Tracker**
###### Blake Craig: Physical Computing -- Utility

### What is the Autonomous Attendance Tracker?
The Autonomous Attendance Tracker is a helpful tool for professors and teachers to track the overall attendance of a class. Meant at the beginning of class, this code will output an attendance of students with a given error threshold. This code implements motion detection features taken from a [python motion detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxmZ9zczptg) video.

### Creator Statement:
The Autonomous Attendance Tracker is designed for the ability to provide a rough estimate for attendance, allowing professors to freely focus on their class and not on who is present. This system simply plugs into the wall and allows professors to track movement in and out of the classroom. I wanted to get rid of any manual interaction with the system because it would hinder ease and accessibility for all students and professors.

I was motivated to go through with this project because of the accountability factors this device implements. I have attended many college classes where many students were continuously absent and seeing it affect the professor’s teaching ability. I can’t deny that I understand the temptation to miss class, but I wholeheartedly believe in the value of going to class. In addition, many students will use excuses to leave class early or to distract themselves, so they don’t have to attend the “boring” or “stressful” class. This device will track that movement.

The box is designed to be small and portable, and susceptible to a large amount of light. My hardest challenge was measuring the motion detection with a lot of light. The threshold for creating motion detection was originally set extremely high to match the bright lights impacting the camera. However, I altered the code to measure the position of the rectangles per image frame, allowing only the threshold to become a mapping feature.

Although this device is meant for tracking the attendance of people at the beginning of class, the tracker can be altered to measure movement during class as well. I think this code is very low quality, but with a larger budget and more advanced code, this attendance tracker could become very effective for autonomously tracking students. In future implementations, machine learning would be nice, recognizing different features and multiple students entering at the same time. Currently, this code can only assume that one person is walking in at the same time and that the user is walking at a constant speed.
